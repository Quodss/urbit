  ::

  ::    as though all fragments have been acked.  If this message is not

  ::
  ::    If we hear a message ack before we've sent all the fragments for

  ::
  ::    If the ack is for the current message, have |packet-pump delete
  ::    all packets from the message, give the message ack back
  ::    to the client vane, increment .current, and check if this next
